        <br/>Given adirected, weighted graph in the format described below, your task is to nd the shortest distance between two
        vertices A and B in the graph. If there are multiple shortest paths between A and B, you have to nd the path with
        the least number of edges.
        <br/>Input Format
        <br/>The vertices are represented by numbers starting from one. The rst line will include two numbers N and M, the number
        of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph respectively. The following M lines will have three
        numbers each, u, v, w which represents adirected edge between u and v with a weight w. The nal line will have the
        values of A and B, the nodes between which you will have to nd the shortest path.
        <br/>Output Format
        <br/>Print two numbers separated by a space: C E, where C is the cost from A to B and E is the number of edges from A
        to B. For unreachable nodes, print -1 -1, denoting no valid distance and no valid number of edges, i.e. C = -1 and
        E = -1.
        <br/>Example 1
        <br/>Consider the following graph. It has ve vertices and ve edges. We have to nd the shortest part from vertex 1 to vertex
        5. There are two shortest paths, based on the weight of the path, from vertex 1 to vertex 5: path 1,2,5 and path
        1,3,4,5. But we want to nd the path with minimum number of edges. So we pick the path with total weight 3 and number
        of edges 2.

    <br /> 1 3 1
    <br /> 2 5 2

    <br /> Output for Example 1
    <br /> 3 2
    <br />
    <br /> Constraints
    <br /> Consider the fact the input graph can be quite large. You should come up with e cient
    <br /> code to avoid the timeout error. However, there is a limit on the number of vertices and
    <br /> number of vertices as follows.
    <br /> 1 &lt;= M &lt;= 104
    <br /> 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 104
