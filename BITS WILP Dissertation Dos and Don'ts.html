<pre>1. Focus on the PPT.
2. Add visualizations like graphs, tables, flow charts for explaining the project idea.
3. Make sure you know that what you write in the PPT
4. You will only get 10-15 minutes for presenting your idea (and you will definitely be knowing more than your faculty).
5. Give yourself or someone else a demo presentation before the event of actual presentation
6. By the time of mid-semester report submission, 80-90% of the coding should be over
7. Your final grade depends on the PPT and presentation (Outline and Mid-semester reports are mere formalities)
8. Faculty might ask you to run the code.
9. Think about the 'expansion plans' for the project in the future.
10. How is it relevant to the industry? About its use cases in the industry.
11. Do not make the topic of dissertation too particular that it looks like a small assignment problem.
12. In the viva at the end of the semester, you will have to justify that your project required around three to four months of effort.
13. The dissertation result could be one of five grades: EX (Excellent), GD (Good), FR (Fair), PR (Poor) and RRA (Required to Register Again).
